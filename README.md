- 👋 Hi, I'm Diego (not Maradona)
- 👀 I'm interested in being able to stop being poor like Maradona (he became number 10) I hope to be a 1.1 or 2.0 at most
- 🌱 I am currently learning C++ and working in an uncertain future.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on a good project. I'm not rich but I can help as much as I can, which for now is to sit in front of the PC and write code in C++; I want to learn more about third-party libraries.
- 📫 How to contact me: You can do it by sending me an email pereyrasayago@gmail.com or my whatsapp wa.me/+5492216904694
